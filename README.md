# Bug Catcher

The **so_long** project is part of the 42 curriculum, where the objective is to create a simple 2D game using the MiniLibX library.
The game includes basic elements like movement, collectibles, and an exit.
This game uses pokemon textures and sprites for graphical representation and involves simple gameplay mechanics.
